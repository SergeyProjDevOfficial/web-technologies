					But this is not background image. You can only do this to a block, but not a inline element such as a input[type=text]. Or am I wrong? – deerchao Dec 7 '11 at 7:09

					no need for the class="stretch", just use #background img {} as identifier in the css – BerggreenDK Aug 24 '12 at 8:04
					z-index: -1; keeps your image in the background. If you desire to show your image in the foreground, you can either increase the z-index value or remove that index. – gokhanakkurt Oct 7 '13 at 16:09
					The issue I am having is with IE8. The background image of a DIV stretches full but in IE8 the images goes outside the DIV hence not being able to see the full image. It gets cropped out. Here is my question: stackoverflow.com/questions/22331179/… – Si8 Mar 11 '14 at 17:25

					The obvious mistake people do is to put the background image in the css (ie by background : url("example.png");) and then use the css attribute background-size:100%; beneath it to hopefully scale the image to screen width. This will not work, Will it? If you wish to put a background image for the body then an image attribute should be added to the body tag like <body background="example.png">
					. Then use css background-size:100%; to scale it. – sjsam Jan 7 '15 at 8:52
